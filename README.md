# fcc-todo-app
Hail freeCodeCamp! This project introduced and gave me exposure to a truck load of concepts. localStorage and associated methods for persisting data, setting, retrieving and deleting data from localStorage. Also, leaned further into handling input fields , performing CRUD operations and displaying those changes to in the DOM's UI. Also got exposure to the toggle() method, no more having to use classList.add()/remove()!
